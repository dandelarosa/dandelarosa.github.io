I'm an industry veteran with over five years of experience working in multiple levels of the tech stack.

Most of my career has been spent as Lead ~~iOS~~ Engineer at a Brooklyn-based startup called Makr. Makr started in 2013 as an iPad app for designing business cards, wedding invitations, and other printed materials; one of my earliest contributions was digging into low-level Apple frameworks to develop the app's project viewer and editor. The company later pivoted into a web-based branding tool for small business, and my role transitioned into DevOps for JavaScript and Ruby microservices. Makr was acquired by Staples in 2015 and continued to operate until it closed business in 2019.

Nowadays I'm working at a multinational advertising company and I continue to consult for progressive-minded tech organizations. When I am not coding you could spot me [researching income investing strategies](https://www.dd64finance.com) or contributing to my [Mets/Steelers fan blog](https://www.instagram.com/dd64sn/).
