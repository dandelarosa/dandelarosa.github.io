I'm an industry veteran with over five years of experience working in multiple levels of the tech stack.

My career began as Lead ~~iOS~~ Engineer at a Brooklyn-based startup called Makr. Makr started in 2013 as an iPad app for designing business cards, wedding invitations, and other printed materials. During the company's early years, I dug into Apple's low-level frameworks to develop the app's project viewer and editor. The company later pivoted into a web-based branding tool for small business, and my role transitioned into DevOps for JavaScript and Ruby microservices. Makr was acquired by Staples in 2015 and continued to operate until it closed business in 2019.

Nowadays I work on an adtech product called Epsilon PeopleCloud Discovery. Read an overview of my professional work at [dandelarosa.net](//www.dandelarosa.net).
