title: "One Year of Weekly Blog Posts – The Streak Ends Today"
---

Today marks the 55th straight week publishing a blog post, starting with [No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders]({% post_url 2020-06-28-extreme-ownership-2 %}) last June. This means I’ve been doing this for over a year.

Here are some highlights from the past year:
- I’ve produced several programming-related posts:
  - [Refactoring: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism]({% post_url 2020-09-19-refactoring-replace-conditional-with-polymorphism %})
  - [Ruby Discourages Private Class Methods]({% post_url 2020-09-27-ruby-discourages-private-class-methods %})
  - [My Quest for Elegant Code]({% post_url 2020-10-25-my-quest-for-elegant-code %})
  - [Reading List: RESTFul API Best Practices]({% post_url 2020-11-08-reading-list-restful-api-best-practices %})
  - [Getting Acquainted With JSON API]({% post_url 2020-11-15-getting-acquainted-with-json-api %})
  - [My Appearance at nyc.rb: Discussing Code Reviews]({% post_url 2021-04-17-nyc-rb-97-things-code-reviews %})
  - [How to Properly Mock a Class in Rspec]({% post_url 2021-06-06-rubocop-rspec-anyinstance %})
  - [Use Ruby's Splat Operator to Test Presence of a Randomly Generated Array]({% post_url 2021-06-13-rspec-splat-random-arrays %})
  - [Coding Wins: June 19, 2021]({% post_url 2021-06-19-coding-wins %})
  - [Coding Wins: June 26, 2021]({% post_url 2021-06-26-coding-wins %})
- A series of essays on the book [Extreme Ownership]({% post_url 2020-06-14-extreme-ownership-1 %}), taking the ideas in [each chapter]({% post_url 2020-09-05-extreme-ownership-12 %}) and seeing how they apply to my past and present experiences.
- A monthly segment called [Elsewhere in the Universe]({% post_url 2021-07-02-elsewhere-in-the-universe-june-2021 %}) exploring the more fun side of things.

The streak took a lot of work to maintain, and I’m proud to have reached this milestone. However, I will be posting less often from now on. I’m not sure about the frequency, but it will likely not be weekly anymore.

It was a huge commitment hitting these weekly deadlines, putting all of my focus on whatever I could deliver that particular weekend. Despite my efforts I was unable to speed up the process, nor was I able to build a backlog of content. Over time it was clear I had to make a decision: continue weekly blog posts at the expense of everything else, or to look for more fruitful endeavors.

I’ll use the weekend of the 17th to take time off; afterwards, I’ll return to projects I’ve put on the backburner. These initiatives require a larger investment, but will hopefully yield greater returns. Stay tuned for updates.
