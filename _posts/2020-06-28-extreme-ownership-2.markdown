title: "Extreme Ownership: No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders"
---
When Jeff Sutherland served as a cadet at West Point, he became the training officer of cadet company L2. This company was nicknamed the "Loose Deuce" for their history as the bottom ranked parade formation at the academy for over a century. Sutherland made L2 a more competitive team by pointing out problems in their marching routine. One of the marchers stuck his sword in the dirt, another failed to turn in time, and the commander's commands weren't clear or timely enough. By making these problems visible to the company they were able to make incremental improvements. In a matter of weeks the Loose Deuce went from the worst performer to the number one company at West Point.

This anecdote is often brought up when discussing the Scrum framework, but it is also an example of the second principle from _Extreme Ownership_: No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders.
