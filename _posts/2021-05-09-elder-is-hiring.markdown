title: "Elder is Hiring!"
---

Ellen, once-CEO of Makr and one of my former managers, is at it again. This time she started a company called Elder, focused on elderly care technology. Currently they have a CTO and one of Makr’s frontend engineers, and Ellen secured the funds needed to expand the team even further.

I’m unable to join my colleague since I’m in the middle of rebuilding the Epsilon PeopleCloud Discovery team at Publicis Groupe. But, if you’re interested check out these open positions:

- [Full-Stack Engineer](https://www.elder.us/fullstack-engineer)
- [Frontend Engineer](https://www.elder.us/frontend-engineer)
- [Embedded Firmware Engineer](https://www.elder.us/embedded-firmware-engineer)
