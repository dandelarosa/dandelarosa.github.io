title: "Bye, Esther"
---

It’s happened again. Another engineer has left the team.

This time it’s Esther, our most junior engineer of the group. She joined the team right before I did, and she’s improved a lot as a coder in her time here. Esther was always willing to learn, and she managed to thrive in difficult situations. She’ll do well in her next job.

Mentoring Esther (and my other teammates for that matter) was the first time I’ve had to collaborate with developers ranked lower than me. Other times I was the junior, or I worked with newer engineers as part of a third-party partnership. I’m glad I made things work out in my current gig.

My team keeps shrinking, and it’s time to starting rebuilding. We are in fact hiring, so check out [our job listing](https://smrtr.io/58mbW) if you’re interested.
