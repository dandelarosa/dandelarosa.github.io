Welcome to the monthly segment I like to call Elsewhere in the Universe! I’ve had similar posts under different names, but I think I now have a permanent name for the segment.

Here I show off news, articles, videos, etc. that I find interesting. Not everything I showcase is stuff I found this month, or even this year. I try to stay professional in the rest of the blog, but in here anything goes!

## The Mets Start the 2021 Season

Major League Baseball began their 2021 season this April, and they intend to play a full 162-game season this year. The Mets’ season opening got delayed as their first opponent, the Washington Nationals, reported some personnel had positive COVID tests. This was only one in [a series of postponements](https://www.mlb.com/mets/news/mets-phillies-finale-postponed-by-rain) the team faced over the month of April.

The Mets’ early-season troubles weren’t enough to stop Jacob deGrom from throwing [a 15-strikeout, complete-game shutout](https://www.mlb.com/news/jacob-degrom-sets-career-high-in-strikeouts?game_pk=634429) against the Nationals at the end of the month.

## Mets Beer Podcast

Fellow Mets fan Ceetar (who I mentioned in last [October’s content roundup]({% post_url 2020-11-01-content-roundup-october-2020 %})) started a podcast called [Mets On Tap](https://www.barleyprose.com/podcast/new-mets-on-tap-podcast/). He and his co-hosts discuss team matters as well as the various beers they’re drinking. Sometimes they record while a game is in progress, and it’s fun witnessing them react the same way I do when the game takes a certain turn. Give it a listen!

## AD BREAK (Not Really)

## New Channel Discovered: Sage’s Rain

I checked out videos by [Sage’s Rain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOq-wLPeAhS9TgMEClxwuOg) when they showed up in my recommended feed, and I did not regret making that move. Jump in if you want to hear character analyses on Avatar: The Last Airbender, anime series like Naruto and Attack on Titan, and mainstream Hollywood films while relaxing sounds play in the background.

## The Lightning Round

These are things I want to point out, but don’t want to spend more than a couple of sentences on.

- Lindsay Ellis ([who I highlighted last month]({% post_url 2021-04-03-elsewhere-in-the-universe-march-2021 %})) got mobbed by Twitter for, like, a lot of stuff. Learn about everything that happened in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7aWz8q_IM4). (Content Warning: all of the content warnings)
- Security researcher Brian Krebs released his mobile site [redesign](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/04/new-krebsonsecurity-mobile-friendly-site/)
- The wireless accessory company Ubiquiti is being accused of [covering up a whistlerblower’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS525PqvAlA) security concerns after the company was hit in a data breach last year.
- The Ruby library `mimemagic` [got pulled](https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/25/ruby_rails_code/) after it was found out that it was using incompatible license structures, affecting many Rails users. The incident was reminiscent of when Azer Koçulu “[liberated](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)” the npm package `left-pad` instead of settling a trademark claim, briefly shutting down several web applications.
- WayForward director [Austin Ivansmith](https://twitter.com/IvanDashSmith) appeared on BrainScratch Commentaries' second discussion on the [Mighty Switch Force](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2rj_DBMEY0) games.
- I’m currently building new YouTube music playlists to play at work: [2021: Life Can’t Wait](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq0m8W945yyShJbYxq7Yz5QRdYfpOTHo) and [Spiffy Jazz Beats to Drink/Brawl To](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq0m8W945yz6WRwPE_XOpZfGFjBWlZE7)

## The Main Event

One thing I like to do while doing chores is re-listen to old podcasts. This month’s highlight is an episode of Team Four Star’s Talkcast Podshow from exactly a year ago.

Listen to TFS members Lanipator, Antfish, and MasakoX discuss the following:

- Pandemic life right when COVID was in full swing
- Their thoughts on Final Fantasy VII Remake
- A behind-the-scenes look at their web series, Final Fantasy VII Machinabridged ([whose finale came out later that year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzKDF0jfwZc))
- Other Final Fantasy related memories
