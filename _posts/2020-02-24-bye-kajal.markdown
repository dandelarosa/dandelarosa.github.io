title: "Bye, Kajal"
---

So Friday was my coworker Kajal’s last day. Aside from myself, she was the only senior engineer on our team. We worked on different initiatives, but she was always helpful whenever she had to intervene. Kajal will be returning to the west coast where she’ll be closer to family.

I’ll use this opportunity to remind the readership that you can connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dandelarosa), and once we're connected feel free to ask for a recommendation or other favor to help you out in your career.
