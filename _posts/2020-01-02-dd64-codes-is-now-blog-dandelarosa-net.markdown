Happy New Year everyone! It's been a while since I contributed to this site, and my plan for 2020 is to add more content. Here's what I have lined up:

- Creating simple games on Angular
- How this blog is maintained and modified
- Retrospectives on past development experiences

Also, I've done a slight rebrand: I want to tie this blog with myself, which is why I'm making it a subdomain of my personal site [dandelarosa.net](https://www.dandelarosa.net). DD64 Networks is my umbrella brand for presenting content related to personal finance, professional sports, and other topics; while DD64 Codes seemed like a good tie-in to my other sites at first, I now believe it's more appropriate to keep content related to my current profession in a more standalone entity.
