excerpt: "Saying goodbye to another teammate"
---

Last week, my teammate JJ landed a new gig and left the company. With this turn of events, everyone on the original team I was on (apart from my manager) has moved on to greener pastures.

We were able to hire a software engineer this summer and I thank JJ for helping me get him onboarded. However, this newest departure makes hiring even more important of a priority than ever. We're still interviewing for an [Associate Software Engineer role](https://smrtr.io/58mbW), and we'll start looking for more backfills as well. Feel free to contact me [@dandelarosadev](https://twitter.com/dandelarosadev) on Twitter for details.
